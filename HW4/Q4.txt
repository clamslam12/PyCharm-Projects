To implement a direct address table in which the keys of stored elements do not need to be distinct and the elements can have satellite data, we can 
have each key mapped to a doubly linked list, assuming that fetching an element should return the satellite data of all stored elements. For insertion,
this appends the element to the list in O(1) time. For deletion, this removes the element in linked list in O(1) time in which the element contains
pointers to the previous and next element. For search, this returns the first element or the first node in a linked list in O(1) time.
